# Medical-Image-Segmentation-Desktop-App
This project is a Java application that represents a real-world use of image segmentation in the medical field. Its main objective is to enable doctors to quickly and accurately segment medical images and detect brain tumors. It is designed using a combination of computer vision algorithms and image processing techniques. The application takes raw medical images as input, which are then automatically segmented by the software using thresholding technique. The user can save the processed segments for future use. 

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher.
- ORACLE database (you can find it in the REQUIREMENTS folder).
- OpenCV library (you need to install OpenCV on your computer first).
- JavaFX library (you need to install JavaFX on your computer first).
- Oracle JDBC (you can find it in the REQUIREMENTS folder).

## Installation
1. Open the "SegmentationProject" folder in your preferred Java IDE.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Set your ORACLE username and password (in the DBUtils class).
4. Compile the source code using a Java compiler.

## Usage
1. Enter your login credentials or sign up to create a new account.
2. Once logged in, the application will direct you to the home window where you can see useful information about using the application and the features it offers.
3. Click on the "Upload Image" button to choose the MRI image you want to work with.
4. After selecting an image, you will be directed to the automatic segmentation window.
5. If automatic segmentation does not produce the desired results, you can manually segment the image by clicking on the "Manual Segmentation" button and adjusting the slider until you achieve the desired results.
6. Once the image is successfully segmented, save it to your PC for easy access in the future.

## Troubleshooting
- If the application is not functioning properly, make sure you have installed all the required libraries and dependencies.
- If you encounter errors during compilation, ensure that you are using a compatible version of Java.
